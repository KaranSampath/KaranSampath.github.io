# Projects

## CourseOdyssey {.project-title}

**A personalized platform that allows students to provide their intended degrees (majors, minors, etc.) and planned graduation date, and outputs the set of top-k feasible course plans satisfying those requirements, sorted in descending order on the factor/metric of interest.**

**Technical Implementation:**

- Built using Python, TypeScript, and JavaScript, with a React frontend and a Flask backend
- Worked on optimizing the frontend to uniquely display course plans and optimized user input to handle errors.

## PennBook {.project-title}

**A miniature Facebook application with posting, news, and chat features, on Node.js and using Amazon EC2 and DynamoDB on the backend. Built in Java and JavaScript.**

**Technical Implementation:**

- Built a miniature Facebook application with posting and chat features, on Node.js and using Amazon EC2 and DynamoDB on the backend
- Used Apache Spark to deploy a live News Recommendation system based on user interactions

## [Surveyor](https://github.com/Watts-Lab/surveyor) {.project-title}

**Surveyor generates data driven surveys for online participants. It uses a Python backend to process surveys and a TypeScript frontend to display them.**

**Technical Implementation:**

- Developed a survey infrastructure to automatically process surveys using TypeScript, CSS and Pug
- Parsed and processed surveys using Python (Pandas, Numpy, NLTK) to help interface with the frontend
