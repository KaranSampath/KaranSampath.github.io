    <p class="lead text-left">Hi, I'm Karan Sampath! I'm passionate about developing great products and solving hard problems. My internship at Palantir has given me experience working on customer stacks, with my project focusing on developing new features for code repositories on the core commercial product. In doing so, I have engaged with a range of technologies, from Conda environment management and Gradle build automation to developing TypeScript bindings on the front end. My internship the year before at a healthcare insurance firm helped me gain valuable data science experience dealing with pressing customer issues. My academic coursework complements this with a master's in data science and a bachelor's in an integration of computer science and economics. I am interested in building products and working on hard technology problems, feel free to contact me if you'd like to collaborate!</p>
