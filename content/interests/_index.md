# Hiking and Mountaineering

I'm passionate about hiking, something that was born during my time in high school in the Himalayas. Some of the peaks I've climbed:

- [Tapovan: 4460m / 14640 ft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapovana)
- [Bedni Bugyal: 3354m / 11004 ft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedni_Bugyal)
- [Mount Lafayette: 1600m / 5249 ft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Lafayette)
